This project began as a personal tool for storing and organizing important links related to articles, resources, and courses during my diploma studies. It evolved into a web application that allows users to save their own links under custom categories. The backend is built with PHP, the first server-side language I learned, and the project was developed from scratch. The website is similar to Linktree, although I wasn't aware of such websites when I started. It was deployed using a free domain and hosting service.

## Features

- Save and organize important links.
- Categorize links based on user-defined categories.
- Backend built with PHP, leveraging server-side scripting.
- User-friendly interface for adding and managing links.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a local server environment that supports PHP.
3. Open the project directory in your browser to start using the website.

## Usage

1. Upon loading the website, you'll see options to add links and categories.
2. Add links and assign them to specific categories.
3. The website will display your saved links organized by categories.

## Future Improvements

While the project meets its original goals, there are several potential improvements:

- **User Authentication:** Add user accounts to secure personal link collections.
- **Enhanced UI:** Improve the website's appearance and user experience.
- **Tagging:** Allow users to add tags to links for better organization.
- **Search Functionality:** Implement a search feature to quickly find stored links.
